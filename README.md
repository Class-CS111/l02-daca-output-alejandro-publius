# Lab 02 - DACA + Output

_Learning Objective: demonstrate an understanding of basic variables and output applied to DACA article_

You're working for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office and are in charge of a project to create quick-print replacements for Employment Authorization Cards. In case someone has their card stolen or is lost, they can come into the office and receive a low-resolution print that will be honored until your replacement card is mailed out.

One of the interns on the team just got the template back to you (see code on the left). It's your job to complete the prototype before submitting it, fully documented, to the project manager.

**Given:**

- ASCII art and structure for an Employment Authorization Card (EAC)
- Documentation at the top and `main` method section headings

**Definitions:**

- ASCII art: graphic design technique using computer characters to draw images
- Unicode: Universal Coded Character Set (like ASCII but _way_ bigger!) Can use them using escape character `\u` followed by a Unicode value, but much simpler/more readable to just copy/paste character into code
- Box Drawing Unicode characters: [https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/box-drawing/ (explore website later for more!)](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/box-drawing/)

**Lab ToDo:**

1. Complete program documentation at the top (lines 1-4) [this is how the project manager will know when and who completed the prototype]
2. Create appropriate variables, in the appropriate section of the `main` method, to store data from EAC [this is how the backend team will know what kind of data and names to use for the database that will store over 700,000 DACA recipients information]. You can fill in the data with one of your partners or some sample data.
3. Substitute ██ parts with data from variables you created [this will eventually be upgraded to pull from a database and store the data into the variables you created, so this flexibility is key for scaling up]
4. Ensure you are following all coding convention/style and documentation practices

**Once you have completed the lab, commit your changes and push your repository to turn in your work. There are <ins>no tests</ins> to run for this lab.**

Done with the lab above? Only then can you attempt the....

**!!!!!Hacker Challenge!!!!!**

- Close off the right side of the card (note this will depend on the values you have for your variables, that's ok!)
- Upgrade ASCII art and/or look of EAC (checkout Unicode webpage link above)
